# thescream

*The scream* is a vibrant and over the top color scheme inspired by the famous composition
from [Edvard Munch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scream) designed for neovim and other command line tools.

Yes, it's vivid, yes, it's flashy, yes, that's intended.

## Why

I wanted to synchronize my day-to-day tools with a single theme and wanted to learn how to create a theme for neovim. That's it.
